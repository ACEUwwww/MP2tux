Warning bugs:

1.The first bug that I met is that when I run the adventure, the QEMU crashed in blackness for no reason.
	for (i=0;i<STATUS_X_DIM;i++) 
    {
        for (j=0;j<STATUS_Y_DIM;j++)
        {
            status_buffer[i*STATUS_X_DIM+j]=0;/* fill the status bar with the color of background */
        }
    }
For this code, I wrongly put STATUS_Y_DIM and STATUS_X_DIM in the opposite position, which makes it a segmentation fault and let the kernal crash.
I ran the gdb and found that there was a seg fault here.

2.When I run my adventure, there's nothing in the bottom of the screen.

I found it's that my caculation of my split screen is wrong. I re-caculated it and get the right register editted and the bug is fixed.

3. When I run the adventure after I fixed the above two bugs, I found the position of the character is not correct.
The offset of one of my position is not right.
 status_plane_buffer[m*STATUS_X_WIDTH+n]=status_buffer[m*STATUS_X_DIM+4*n+i];
I firstly wrongly caculated the offset.

4. I found the bottom is flashing rapidly
I didn't change the value of target_img to 0X05A0 but 0000;
